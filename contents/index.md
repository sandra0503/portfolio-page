  headline: Hi there!
  text: My name is Sandra, I'm a frontend developer from Germany. I'm developing customized websites and other digital products in agile teams since 2014. I studied Media Informatics with focus on human-computer-interaction (HCI) in Munich. What I love about building digital products, is the process of creating awesome new things together with other people and connecting technology with design and user experience! In my free time I love music, good food, yoga practice and traveling.

    title: Agile way of working
    anchor: agile
    details: In the last few years I had the chance to work in various agile team settings, most of which were applying the <b>Scrum</b> framework to their processes. As a scrum team member I take backlog groomings, plannings and retrospectives seriously. I always contribute my part during the meetings and I enjoy to plan as well as to reflect sprints effectively together with my team. I like the short ways of <b>communication</b>, <b>freedom</b> in decisions and quick <b>outcome</b> of agile team work.

    title: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
    anchor: js
    details: While I'm confident in building state-of-the-art frontend for web applications, I'm <b>always learning</b> new things and technologies. Besides a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I'm familiar with <b>JS frameworks</b> like React or Angular, currently especially with <b>Vue.js</b>. Of course I'm also not afraid of connecting to APIs and backend systems. In my most recent project we are building a mobile-first online shop implemented with Zalando's Mosaic 9 stack.

    title: Focus on UX/UI
    details: My goal is not only to deliver great code, I do also have a strong focus on user interface and UX when developing new features. I love to collaborate closely with design and user experience experts, to learn from each other and to create new things together. I thrive to build websites, applications and features which are <b>truly valuable</b> to users and have a <b>positive impact</b> in the world. My background in HCI is helpful for designing data-driven user studies and tests.
