    title: Agile way of working
    anchor: agile
    details: In the last few years I was working in various agile team settings, mostly within the <b>Scrum</b> framework. As a scrum team member I take backlog groomings, plannings and retrospectives seriously. I always contribute my part during the meetings and I enjoy to plan as well as to reflect sprints together with my team members. I like the short ways of <b>communication</b>, <b>freedom</b> in decisions and quick <b>outcome</b> of agile team work.

    title: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
    anchor: js
    details: While I'm confident in building the frontend part of state-of-the-art web applications, I'm always learning new things and technologies. Besides a deep knowledge of HTML, CSS and <b>JavaScript</b>, I'm familiar with frameworks like React, Angular or <b>Vue.js</b>. Of course I'm also not afraid of connecting to APIs and backend systems. In my most recent project we were building a mobile-first online shop implemented with Zalando's Mosaic 9 stack.

    title: Focus on UX/UI
    details: My goal is not only to deliver good code, I do also have a strong focus on <b>user interface</b> and <b>user experience</b> when developing products and features. I enjoy to collaborate closely with designers and user experience experts. I thrive to build websites, applications and features which are <b>truly valuable</b> to users and have a <b>positive impact</b> on the world. My background in HCI is helpful for designing data-driven user studies and tests.
