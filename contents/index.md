  headline: Hi there!
  text: My name is Sandra, I'm a frontend developer from Germany. I'm developing customized websites and other digital products in agile teams since 2014. I studied Media Informatics with focus on Human-Computer-Interaction in Munich. What I love about building digital products, is the process of creating awesome new things together with other people and connecting technology with design and user experience! In my free time I love music, good food, yoga practice and traveling.

    anchor: agile
    details: In the last few years I had the chance to work in various agile team settings, most of which applied the Scrum framework to their processes. As a Scrum team member I take Backlog groomings and Sprint plannings seriously, I always contribute my part to split bigger topics into smaller stories and I enjoy to plan Sprints effectively together with the team. I like the shorter ways of communication, the freedom in smaller decisions and the quick outcome of working agile.

    title: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
    anchor: js
    details: While I'm confident in building state-of-the-art frontend for web applications, I'm always learning new things and technologies. Besides a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I'm familiar with JS frameworks like React or Angular, but at the moment especially with Vue.js. I'm also not afraid of connecting to APIs and backend systems. In my most recent project we are building a mobile-first online shop implemented with Zalando's Mosaic 9 stack.
