  headline: Hi there!
  text: My name is Sandra, I'm a frontend developer from Germany. I'm developing customized websites and other digital products in agile teams since 2014. Before I studied Media Informatics with focus on Human-Computer-Interaction in Munich. What I love about building digital products, is the process of creating awesome new things together with other people and connecting technology with design and user experience! In my free time I love music, good food, yoga practice and traveling.
